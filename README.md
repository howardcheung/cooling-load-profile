# Introduction
This repository is used to host the development of a software with graphical user interface to analyze cooling load of a builiding from raw data recorded by a building managmenet system (BMS). It aims at creating a simple graphical user interface for anyone to generate histograms and useful time series plots for anyone who obtains cooling load data from BMS with a time column and a cooling load column.

# Language and libraries to be used
The language and libraries to be used for this software development are
* Python 3.5.1
* matplotlib (1.5.1)
* pandas (0.18.1)
